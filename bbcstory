What did you get out of university? 
For me, it was an expanded waistline, almost £30,000 of tuition fees frittered away, and three years of my life wasted. 
Oh, and a framed certificate in my parents’ hall.

My ideas about what student life would be like were all wrong. 
I’m a big fan of the E4 show Fresh Meat, which shows a group of friends at university having a wild time. 
My experience was nothing like that! It was just me alone in my room the whole time.

Part of the problem was that my halls of residence were filled with lots of mature students who didn’t go out much. They were just there to get their degree and leave. 

At school, I had a big group of friends. 
We all lived close to each other and went out all the time. 
The worst part was that I lost them as friends too. 
They seemed to love their universities and stayed there during the holidays, so we grew apart.
